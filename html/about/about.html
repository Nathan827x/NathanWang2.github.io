    <h1> About Me </h1>
    <p>I grew up in Hoover Alabama and went to school at Mississippi State University, where I graduated in May 2017 with a Bachelorâ€™s degree in Electrical Engineering. During my schooling, I realized too late that I enjoyed programming more. Since school has ended I have been dedicating my time to working on projects and learning more about web development.</p>
    <p>Aside from web development projects I enjoy mobile application development as well solving problems on HackerRank. Some of my non-technical hobbies are playing tennis, basketball, fitness, and the occasional video games.</p>
