    <h1> About Me </h1>
    <p> I grew up in Hoover Alabama and went to school at Mississippi State University where I graduated May 2017 with a Bachelorâ€™s in Electrical Engineering. During my schooling, I realized too late that I enjoyed programming more than the Electrical side. Since school has ended I have been dedicating my time working on projects and learning more about web development.</p>
    <p>Aside from web development project I enjoy mobile application development as well using hackerrank. Some of my non-technical hobbies are playing tennis, basketball, fitness, and the occasional video games.</p>
